# 1st project - Prof. Sanjeev Jha.
- we are predicting avalnache sites in the himalyan region.
- this will be made with rohit bhaiya.
  ### What has to be done.
  - Reading and developing my own understanding of different models, and applying it to the project.
  - making the report of which model would be good the senior asked me to.
  - loading the data set.
  - intrpolating values whenever required.
  - analysing the data set and cropping it to the upper himalyan region.
  - classifying data, if random forest model is chossen.
  - if gpr - then itll be a semi supervised moedel.
  ### Progress
  - understood the general procedure of how to approach a climate dataset, and understanding its dimenssions and thier meaning (from surface).
    #### general procedure:
    1. convert the coordinates if required
    2. plot some plots, using xarray is easy with that, but the Dataset from netCDF4 module is more practical for a small dataset.
    3. make a custom grid and then add data
    4.  and then proceed to do the rest of the work.(splitting and and rest of the things are to be learned yet).
# 2nd project - tiwari bhaiya.(this will take some time)
- We are predicting the health impact of pollution on th northern states of india
- a hybrid radnom forest is to be used(according to the paper), but something else can also be used.
# 3rd project - Prof. Sanjeev Jha.
- this is profs paper most probably.
- Analysing mumbai basin, and fitting the data for 3 years.
- Then calculate the weighted average for each part in each grid, ans then sum them up to and assign this value to the main centroid of that particular shape.
